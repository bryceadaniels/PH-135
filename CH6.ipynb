    "A dictionary is a multi-element object just like a list or tuple but instead of connecting each element to an integer index value, a keyword is used.  Dictionaries allow you to access data without knowing anything about the order of the items.  For example, maybe you want to store the orbital radius of all the planets in the solar system. Using a dictionary you can associate the name of the planet with its orbital radius.  A string containing the planet's name could serve as the key and the associated radius as the value.  \n",
