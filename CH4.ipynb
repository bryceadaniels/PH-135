    "5. (Triangle Classification)  There is a simple criteria to determine whether a triangle can be formed from a set of specified side lengths.  The criteria states that the sum of any two sides must be larger than the third side.  This criteria must be satisified for all possible combinations of two sides if the triangle is to be valid.  If the triangle is valid, the angles can be found by first using the law of cosines to find the first two angles $$c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2 a b \\cos(C)$$  and then choosing the third angle so that the sum of the three angles add up to $180^\\circ$.\n",

    "    2. If a triangle can be formed, use the law of cosines to calculate the triangle's angles. Print the angles in degrees.  Check your code for several choices of side lengths to verify that it is working.\n",
    "    3. All valid triangles are classified according to the largest angle present (acute, obtuse, and right) and also according to their side lengths (scalene - no sides equal, isoscelese - two sides equal and equilateral - all sides equal). Modify your code to determine the classification of a triangle (i.e. obtuse scalene) and print that classification to screen.\n"
