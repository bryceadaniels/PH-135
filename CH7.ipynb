[^relax] The first few iterations of this process might look something like this: $$(x_\\text{old})_1 = 2 \\text{ (starting guess)}$$ $$(x_\\text{new})_1 = \\sin((x_\\text{old})_1)$$ $$(x_\\text{old})_2 = (x_\\text{new})_1$$ $$(x_\\text{new})_2 = \\sin((x_\\text{old})_2)$$ $$(x_\\text{old})_3 = (x_\\text{new})_2$$ $$(x_\\text{new})_3 = \\sin((x_\\text{old})_3)$$\n",
